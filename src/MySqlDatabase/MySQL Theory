Database:
-it is an organized collection of related information
-you can store data in the form of table
-databases support storage and manipulation 

DBMS:
ACID properties:
Types of DBMS:


SQL:structured Query Language
MySQL :database language for dealing with relational database

Data Type:
1.Numeric Data Type:
	i.tinyint-1byte space and can store 4 digit no
	ii.smallint-2byte space and can store 5 digit no
	iii.midiumint-3byte space and can store 9 digit no
	iv.int-4byte-11digits
	v.bigint-8byte-20digit
	vi.float(m,d) 2byte 24digits ex.price float(10,2);-->10237898.65(10 digit and last two are precision )
	vii.double(m,d) 8byte  53places
	viii.decimal(m,d)  each decimal value corresponds to 1byte
	bit
	bool/boolean
	
2.Date and Time:
 	year     1byte    2/4digit
 	date     3byte    yyyy-MM-dd pattern
 	time     3byte    HH:mm:ss
 	datetime 5byte    yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
 	timestamp 4byte+fractional seconds  yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss with timeStamp
	
3.String:
	char
	varchar(size)     max size:255char
	tinytext(size)	   max size:255char
	text(size)       Maximum size of 65,535 characters.
	mediumtext(size)   It can have a maximum size of 16,777,215 characters.
	longtext(size)     It can have a maximum size of 4GB or 4,294,967,295 characters.
	binary             max size:255char
	varbinary          max size:255char
	
4.BLOB(binary large object)
	tinyblob    255byte
	blob        65535bytes
	mediumblob    1,67,77,215 bytes
	longblob    4gb
	
	SQL commands:
	1.DDl-data definition language-alter,create,truncate,rename,drop
	-it is related to structure of table
	2.DML-data manipulation language-insert,update,delete
	3.DRL-data retrieval language-select
	4.TCL-Transaction control language-commit,Rollback,savepoint
	5.DCL-data controlled language-grant,revoke
	
	truncate:used to delete all the records from the table
	drop:used to delete entire table means structure also will delete
	
	Why is truncate a DDL command?

Then why truncate is a DDL command since it is acting on data,
 ideally it should also be under DML. 
 This has been most asked in interviews.
 It is because when we apply truncate internally it drops the table first then re-creates the schema/structure of that table.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Question:
1.Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given input as integer array in which consecutive elements should have a difference of 4 or more than 4.

If the above condition matches display “1” else “0”

Input and Output Format :
First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array elements. 
Output consist of an integer, which is the either 1 or 0

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is a negative number and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative numbers available in the input array and terminate the program.

Sample Input 1:
6
1
5
10
6
2
7

Sample Output 1:
1

Sample Input 2:
-8

Sample Output 2:
Invalid array size
