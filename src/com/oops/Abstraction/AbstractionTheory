Abstraction:abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it
-There are two ways to achieve abstraction:
1.Abstract Class  2.Interface

Abstract method:
-A method that is declared as abstract and does not have implementation in abstract class is known as abstract method

Abstract Class:
-Abstract class needs to extended and its method implementation
-it can not be instantiated
-you can insert constructor,abstract method or non abstract(concrete method) or combination of both
If you are extending any abstract class that have abstract method,you must either provide the implementation or make this class as abstract
if there is any abstract method in a class,that class must be abstract

Interface:
-it is blueprint of a class
-it has static constant(public static final)and abstract method(public abstract)
-since java8 u can insert static and default method
-it represent is a relationship
-it can not be instantiated just like abstract class
-it is a mechanism to achieve Abstraction
-it supports the functionality of multiple interface
-it is used to achieve loose coupling

interface inerface_nme{
variable;//public static final(compiler will take it by default)
method;//public abstract
}

class --extends--class
class--implements--interface
interface--extends --interface
