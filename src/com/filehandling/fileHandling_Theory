Types of files:
  1.Byte /Stream oriented:
  can read /write byte as well as char oriented data
    read => FileInputStream
    write => FileOutStream

  2.Character Oriented:
  can read only char oriented data
    read => FileReader
    write => FileReader

java.io.*;
Stream:
-sequence of data and it is composed of bytes
-In java 3 Streams are created for us automatically:
1.System.out  2.System.in  3.System.err

InputStream:it is used to read from a source
OutputStream: it is used to write data to destination

Classes for byte oriented file:
1.OutputStream Class:
-it is an abstract class
-it is super class of all the classes representing in outputStream of byte
methods:
1.public void write(int) throws IOException:used to write a byte int,char or ascii of char
A-67,a-97 ascii
2.public void write(byte[])throws IOException
3.public void flush() throws IOException
4.public void close() throws IOException

2.InputStream Class:
-it is an abstract class
-super class of all the classes representing an input stream of byte
methods:
1.public abstract int read()throws IOException:it will return ascii and reads next byte of data and returns -1 at the end of the file
2.public int available()throws IOException:will check next byte is present or not if present it return that byte
3.public void close()throws IOException

Serialization:
-is mechanism of writing a state of an object into a byte stream
-it is mainly used to travel object's state on the network(known as Marshaling)
-reverse operation of serialization is called Deserialization

java.io.Serializable Interface:
-it is marker Interface(has no data members and methods)
-it is used to mark java classes so that objects of these classes may get certain capability
-it must be implemented by the class whose object you want to persist(store)
-String class and all the wrapper classes implements serializable interface by default

ObjectOutputSream Class:
-it is used to write primitive data  type and java object to an outputStream
-only object that support serializable interface can be return to stream
methods:
1.public final void writeObject(object obj)throw IOException:used to write the specified boj to the byte sream
2.public void flush()throw IOException
3.public void close()throw IOException


Deserialization:
-it is the process of reconstructing object from the serialized state
ObjectInputStream class:
-it deserializes object and primitive data written using ObjectOutput stream
methods:
1.public final Object readObject()throws IOException,ClassNotFoundException:read object from the byte stream
2.public void flush()throw IOException
3.public void close()throw IOException



q:
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given an input array which contains age of some employees, write a program to find the sum of ages of employees greater than 18.

Input and Output Format :
First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array elements. Output consist of an integer, which is the sum.

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is a negative number and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative number available in the input array and terminate the program.

Include a function named newArraySum(int age[],int size) whose return type is an integer, which is the sum.

Sample Input 1:
5
21
22
17
10
25
Sample Output 1:
68

Sample Input 2:
6
50
-36

Sample Output 2:
Invalid input


q2:
Write a program to find if the student is eligible for first, second or third grade universities by finding the average of their marks given in the input integer array.
If the size of the array is negative or if any element in the array is negative or if the average marks scored by the student is greater than 99 , print “Invalid Input” and terminate the program.
 Input and Output Format:
Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to n, the number of elements in the array. The next 'n' integers correspond to the elements in the array.
Output consists of a string --- “First Grade University” or “Second Grade University” or “Third Grade University” or “Invalid Input”.
Assume that the maximum size of the array is 20.
Sample Input 1:
5
92
87
78
74
80
 
Sample Output 1:
First Grade University
 Sample Input 2:
-5
Sample Output 2:
Invalid Input
Sample Input 3:
5
23
2
-5
 Sample Output 3:
Invalid Input

q3:
Q.3
Jim got his salary. His salary calculations are as follows.
From his Basic amount he gets 50% of his basic for house Rent allowances and 75% of his basic as special allowances . 
If the number of days he worked is 31 he gets 500 extra. Write a program to calculate his gross salary after calculating all his salary split up.
 
Include a function named calculateGross that accepts 2 integer arguments and returns a float. 
The first integer corresponds to Jim's basic salary and the second integer corresponds to the number of days Jim has worked. 
The function returns a float that corresponds to the gross salary.

 Print Invalid Input and terminate the program in the following cases:
1.       Basic salary is greater than 10000
2.       Number of working days is greater than 31
3.       Basic salary is negative
4.       Number of working days is 0 or negative
Input and Output Format:
Input consists of 2 integers. The first integer corresponds to Jim's basic salary and the second integer corresponds to the number of days he has worked.
Output consists of a single float that corresponds to Jim's gross salary. The gross salary is displayed correct to 2 decimal places.
 Sample Input 1:
5000
30
 Sample Output 1:
11250 .00
 Sample Input 2:
5000
0
Sample Output 2:
Invalid Input
