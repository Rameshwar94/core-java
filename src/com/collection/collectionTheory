Framework:Java frameworks are bodies of reusable pre-written code acting as templates that developers can use to create applications by filling in custom code as needed.
i.e set of libraries

Disadvantages of Array:
1.fixed size
2.it is complex to insert/delete an element from the start of the array or from the middle of the array
3.we need to write a code to search/sort the array elements,predefined methods are not available
4.only homogeneous elements can store.

Collection:
it is architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

All the classes and interfaces of collection are in java.util.*

need of collection:
1.to get dynamic data structure
2.to get heterogeneous  data structure

List:
1.ArrayList:
-internally uses growable array
-it can contain duplicate elements
-it maintains insertion order
-non synchronized(MultiThreded)
-Null insertion is possible
-heterogeneous objects allowed
-it is serializable and cloneable inteface
-best choice for retrieval but not for manipulation because its slow
- default the capacity of ArrayList is 10.
public void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity); 
new capacity=(current capacity*3/2)+1




Iterator:
-it provides the facility of iterating the elements in forward direction only.
methods:
1.public boolean hasNext();-->it returns true if iterator hs more elements
2.public Object next();-->it returns the element and moves the cursur pointer to the next element
3.public void remove();-->it removes the last element returned by the iterator .it is rarely used.

for each loop:
for(Type_of_object  ref :Name_of_List ){
syso(ref);
}



hw:
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given the basic salary as input, write a program to calculate the bonus and display it.

The bonus will be calculated based on the below category.
Basic>20000 bonus=17%of basic+1500
Basic>15000 bonus=15%of basic+1200
Basic>10000 bonus=12%of basic+1000
for rest =8%of basic+500

Input and Output Format :

First line of input consists of n, the basic salary.
Output is a single integer that displays the bonus.

Print "Number too large" when the given input numbers is greater than 32767 .
Print "Number too small" when the given input is a negative number.

Include a function named calculateBonus(int basic) whose return type is an integer, the bonus.

Sample Input 1:
21000

Sample Output 1:
5070

Sample Input 2:
327678
Sample Output 2:
Number too large

q.2
Q.
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Write a program to generate new number from the given input based on following conditions.

(i) Even digit should be replaced by next Even digit.
(ii) Odd digit should be replaced with next Odd digit

Input and Output Format :
Input consists of an integer. Output is also an integer.

1) Print "Number too small" when any of given input numbers is a negative number.
2) Print "Number too large" when any of given input numbers is greater than 32767.


Sample Input 1:
123

Sample Output 1:
345

Sample Input 2:
32768

Sample Output 2:
Number too large
