Software Testing:
-to Avoid failure
-we need to identify fault ,means process of discovering the causes of failure
-process of ensuring that the failure does not happen again is called fault correction or fault removal
-to test our programming we will use Unit Testing framework.

What is JUnit?
- JUnit is standard unit testing framework is known as JUnit.
- It is an open source framework
- programmer can create test cases and test his/her own code
- to perform unit testing we need to create test cases
- unit test is a code which ensure that the program logic works as expected
- current version is JUnit 4

Feature of JUnit:
- IT is a framework which is used for writing and running test cases
-provides annotations to identify test method
-provides assertion for testing expected reason
-provides test Runners for running tests
-it allows you to write code faster which increases quality
-it is elegantly simple,less complex and takes less time
-JUnit test can run automatically and they check their own results and provides immediate feedback
-JUnit test can be categorized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites
-It shows test progress in a bar that is green if test is running smoothly,it turns red when a test fails

What is Unit Test Case:
-a unit test case is a part of code which ensures that another part of code(method) works as expected
-to achieve a desired result quickly,a test framework is required and JUnit is perfect test framework for java
-a formal written a unit test case is characterized by a known input and expected output
-there must be atleast 2 unit test cases,one +ve test case nd one -ve test case.

Assert Class:
-All Assertion methods are present in assert class
-Assert class provides a set of assertion methods,useful for writing test case

Methods:
1.void assertEquals(boolean expected,boolean actual)
2.void assertTrue(boolean condition)
3.void assertFalse(boolean condition)
4.void assertNoNull(Object obj):check that an object is not null
5.void assertNull(Object obj):check that an object is null
6.void assertSame(obj1,obj2):tests if two object references point to the same object
7.void ssertNotSame(obj1,obj2):test if two object references do not point to the same object
8.void asertArrayEquals(expected array,actual array)


practice que:
1.Write +ve and -ve test case to check  a method checkAge() age>=18,true
2.write +ve and -ve test case to check  login(),usernme="admin",password="admin123"
