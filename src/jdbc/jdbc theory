steps to add referenced library:
right click on ur project->build path->configure build path->add external jar->go to c drive->program files(x86)->mysql->connector j 8.0->
mysql-connector j8.0->apply->apply and close

steps to connect java with database:
1.import java .sql.*package

2.register driver(in mysql 8 version it is not required we can omit that step)
class.forName("driver_name");

3.Establish connection
Connection con =DriverManager.getConnection(url,username,password);

4.create a Statement
Statement stmt=con.createStatement();

5.Execute statement
ResultSet rs=stmt.executeQuery("select * from customer")

6.retrieve result
while(rs.next()){
//....

7.close connection
con.close();
}


PreparedStatement:
PreparedStatement("insert into customer value(?,?,?,?)")

Statement:
-used when query is to be executed only once.
-it is base interface.
-it is used to execute normal sql query.
-we can't use Statement for reading and writing binary data means video and images
-performance is very low

PreparedStatement:
-used when queries is to be executed multiple times
-sub interface of Statement
-used to execute dynamic sql query
-we can use preparedStatement for reading and writing binary data
-performance is better than Statement

CallableStatement:used to call stored procedure.


BLOB/CLOB
binary large object/character large object
clob is not supported in mysql it is supported by oracle instead of this use text data type
BLOB:datatype:used to store binary files ex.images,videos
CLOB:datatype:used to store text files

practice Q:
Student Management System
Student:rollNo,name,dob,percent,address,email-id,phone_no add constraints
1.add student record(use stored procedure)
2.view all student
3.view student by city
4.update student by rollno
5.delete student by rollno
6.search students based on percentage 
enter min and max range from user
7.display details of 1st ranker
8.search student details by rollno
