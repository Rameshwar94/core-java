pritnln is a Method present in PrintStream Class

Getting input from user:
1.scanner
2.bufferReader- Integer.ParseInt throws NumberFormatException,IOException
			  -we have to pass InputStreamReader obj to BufferReader obj
If u have multiple classes in file the file name should be same as PUBLIC class name

conditional statements:
if else
if else ladder :else if after if
if else nested:if inside if or else

que:1.accept age from user check he/she is eligible for license or not
2.accept no from user and check wether it is even or odd
3.accept 3 no from user and disply greatest no
4.accept a no from user and check wether it is +ve,-ve,0
5.accept marks of 3 subject and cal total, percentage and grade
6.accept salary of person and print taxAmount,tax is 10% if income is less than 25000 otherwise 15%
7.accept perchase amount from the user and print discount amount 10% discount on purchase if amount is >=10000,otherwise 2% discount
8.accept no of calls from user and print bill amount .rupees 1/call charged if no of calls less than 200,otherwise rupees 3/call

Switch case:menu driven program
switch(choise){
case 1:statements;
	break;
	.
	.
	.
	case n:staements;
	break;
	.
	default:
}

choise:int,char ,String

loops:
for loop-if u know the range go with for loop
while loop-entry control loop
do while loop-exit controlled loop,will execute atleast once

1.calculate sum  of digit
2.palindrome no
3.armstrong no

break-break the loop or get out from loop
continue-skip the current iteration and continue with next

Different Methods to Set Precision in Double Values
1.Using format() Method of String class
2.Using round() method of Math class
 ............DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#.##");
 .............System.out.print(" = " + df.format(sum));    //3.14

 Array:collection of similar data types,it has fixed size
 initialization:
 dataType arrayName[] ={value1,value2,.....valuen};
 int a[]={2,3,4,5};
 declaration:
 dataType arrayName[]=new dataType[size];
 int a[]=new int[5];
 
 que:
 1.accept array elements from user and calculate sum of all array elements
 2.accept array elents from user and print only even elements
 3.accept array elements from user and cal sum of even and product of odd elements

 multi diamentional array
 
 Q.Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Write a function to find second largest number in the given input integer array.

Assume that all elements in the input array are unique.

Input and Output Format :

First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array elements.
Output consist of an integer, which is the second largest.

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is a negative number and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative number available in the input array and terminate the program.

Include a function named secondLargest(int array[], int size) whose return type is an integer, the second largest.

Sample Input 1:
5
3
342
53
2
12

Sample Output 1:
53

Sample Input 2:
5
3
342
53
-2


Sample Output 2:
Invalid input
